## Second Week

This week a learned a little more about the history of the company, where it all began, and how they grow to what they are today.  Particularly I was amazed by how they deal in times of crisis, they mentioned to us that the very last thing they do is firing people, which says too much of their values and the care that they have for all employees and I could not feel more enthusiastic about it. 

Later we had the opportunity seagulls class and I liked the metaphor that was told to us. The metaphor was about seagulls and how they can show where the fishes are even if the fisherman can not see them. This refers to how employees can point out a business opportunity even if the company itself has not seen it.

it was mentioned that whenever the company makes a profit the employees of the company make a profit cause we are on the same team and we all should treat ourselves like that, and personally I could not agree more.

I learned was it liked to be mentored cause I had a meeting with my encora mentors and we chat for half an hour and they seem like very educate and experimented people I really hope I can learn from them. 

Another thing I learned by the end of the week I learned an excellent way to evaluate if the implementations of a stack and a queue are working correctly, this by means of a program that verifies if a string is a palindrome or not, this is done by entering each character of the chain both in a stack and in a queue and then empty both, this works as only if the push (), pop (), enqueue () and dequeue () methods are correctly implemented will get the correct results, otherwise a false positive or negative could occur.
