## Third Week
In this week I learned more about how to deal with clients and how proper communication is fundamental to understand and sometimes more importantly communicate the correct ideas and messages in order to have assertive communication so both parties can have pleasant reunions and the workflow go exactly as it should. 

Having good communication with a client is just as important as the development of a project itself even more important sometimes cause a project may fall apart but a relationship with a client should never go that far, after all, what makes a good company reputation is not only how good are at what they do but how good they relation with their clients.

During this week I also learned a little bit more about perspective and how this affects communication and rather than focusing on what we can see or feel try to understand and think beyond our ideals because sometimes you just do not have the whole picture of things.

And regarding the technical area I solved a code jam problem, to be more precise the moon and umbrellas problem and I had to recheck all the java syntax cause it has been more than 2 years since I have developed a program using this language plus the problem was more challenging than I first anticipated but I really think that solving that problem improved my programming logic.
